Participated in the full-cycle research on optimizing the locust LGMD neuron with feed-forward inhibition (oLGMD), enhancing speed and robustness to translation.

Implemented oLGMD into the embedded system of [*Colias* robot](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96728-8_17) ([1k lines C code](https://github.com/Ryannnice/Supplementary_Materials_FFI_ON_OFF/tree/main)). Conducted closed-loop arena experiments, achieving 97.51% success in collision avoidance while nearly halving processing time compared to previous LGMD models. Handled all online experiments and initial paper writing (introduction, experiments).
