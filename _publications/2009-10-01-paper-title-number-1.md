Conducted a full-cycle research on modeling the LPLC2 neural ensemble of fruit fly *Drosophila* for robust multi-looming object perception and localization. A bottom-up attention mechanism was used to generate attention fields driven by motion-sensitive neural pathways.

Developed the multi-attention LPLC2 (mLPLC2) neural network inspired by the fly visual system ([codebase, 3k lines C/C++](https://github.com/Ryannnice/Offline_Multi-Attention_LPLC2_Model)). Currently integrating the model into the embedded visual-perceptual and motion-control system of [micro robot *Colias*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96728-8_17) ([2k lines C code](https://github.com/Ryannnice/mLPLC2_Colias_Robot)).
