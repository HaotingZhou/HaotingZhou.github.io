## Research Experience

*Machine Life and Intelligence Research Centre, Guangzhou University.*  
Advisor: [Prof. Qinbing Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YIte1M8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)

- **Attention-Driven LPLC2 Neural Ensemble Model for Multi-Target Looming Detection and Localization**, paper accepted at IJCNN, *first author*.  
  Jul. 2024 - Nov. 2024  
  - Conducted a full-cycle research on modeling the lobula plate/lobula columnar, type 2 (LPLC2) neural ensemble of the fruit fly *Drosophila* with ultra-selectivity to looming objects for robust perception and localization of multiple looming objects by leveraging a bottom-up attention mechanism to generate attention fields driven by motion sensitive neural pathways.
  - Developed the multi-attention LPLC2 (mLPLC2) neural network model inspired by the visual system of the fly ([independently, 3k lines of code in C/C++](https://github.com/Ryannnice/Offline_Multi-Attention_LPLC2_Model)). Our current work focus on implementing mLPLC2 model into the embedded visual-perceptual and motion-control system of the [micro robot *Colias*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96728-8_17) in real physical world ([independently, 2k lines of code in C](https://github.com/Ryannnice/mLPLC2_Colias_Robot)).

- **A Computationally Efficient Neuronal Model for Collision Detection with Contrast Polarity-Specific Feed-Forward Inhibition**, article published at *Biomimetics*, *second author*.  
  Mar. 2024 - Jul. 2024  
  - Participated in the entire research on modeling the optimized locust lobula giant movement detector neuron with detailed feed-forward inhibition (oLGMD) to enhance processing speed and the robustness towards translating movement.
  - Implemented oLGMD model into the embedded system of [*Colias*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96728-8_17) ([independently, 1k lines of code in C](https://github.com/Ryannnice/Supplementary_Materials_FFI_ON_OFF/tree/main)), and conducted closed-loop arena comparative experiments to evaluate performance of oLGMD, achieving the highest success ratio of collision avoidance at 97.51% while nearly halving the processing time compared with previous LGMD models; conducted all online experiments of this paper, analyzing the results using real-world data collected by the *Colias* robot; designed criteria to assess time efficiency and collision selectivity; led the initial writing of the introduction and experimentation sections; participated in revising the submitted paper.

- **Research on Computational Neuroscience for Collision Detection**  
  Mar. 2023 - Present  
  - Reading and giving reports of research articles during research seminars on a weekly basis.
  - **Provincial Key** College Students' Innovative Entrepreneurial Training Plan Program: Bio-Inspired LGMD Collision Detection Model Leveraging Optical Flow and Learning-Based Optimization.
  - Modeled self-inhibition in neural networks for collision perception against translating motion; developed neuromorphic binocular models for collision prediction which combines directional and depth motion cues; optimized directional-selective neuron parameters using a genetic algorithm; collected a stereo RGB-D dataset capturing diverse indoor-outdoor collision scenarios to support model training and evaluation; conducted online robotic experiments with the [*Colias*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96728-8_17) and [*TurtleBot*](https://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot3/) robots; designed detailed figures illustrating the models and experiments; drafted manuscript introductions, and contributed to manuscript revisions. **One manuscript of the above works is under review, and two are to be submitted**.
