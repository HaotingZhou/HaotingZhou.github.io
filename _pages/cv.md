## üî¨ Research Experience

### Machine Life and Intelligence Research Centre, Guangzhou University  
*Advisor: [Prof. Qinbing Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YIte1M8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)*

- **Attention-Driven LPLC2 Neural Ensemble Model for Multi-Target Looming Detection and Localization**  
  *Jul. 2024 ‚Äì Nov. 2024 | First Author*  
  - Modeled LPLC2 neural ensembles in fruit flies for multi-object looming detection using a bottom-up attention mechanism.  
  - Developed the mLPLC2 model (**3k lines of C/C++**, [GitHub](https://github.com/Ryannnice/Offline_Multi-Attention_LPLC2_Model)), and implemented it into [Colias robot](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96728-8_17) (**2k lines of embedded C**, [GitHub](https://github.com/Ryannnice/mLPLC2_Colias_Robot)).

- **A Computationally Efficient Neuronal Model for Collision Detection**  
  *Mar. 2024 ‚Äì Jul. 2024 | Second Author*  
  - Modeled the optimized LGMD neuron (oLGMD) with feed-forward inhibition.  
  - Implemented oLGMD into embedded system of Colias (**1k lines of C**, [GitHub](https://github.com/Ryannnice/Supplementary_Materials_FFI_ON_OFF)).  
  - Achieved 97.51% success in collision avoidance, nearly halving processing time vs previous models.  
  - Led online experiments and co-authored the paper.

- **Research on Computational Neuroscience for Collision Detection**  
  *Mar. 2023 ‚Äì Present*  
  - Weekly research article reading and reporting.
