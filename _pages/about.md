Welcome to my homepage! I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the School of Mathematics and Information Science, [Guangzhou University](https://english.gzhu.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qinbing Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YIte1M8AAAAJ) at the Machine Life and Intelligence Research Centre, Guangzhou University.

I am actively looking for research or graduate positions for ***<font color = '#CC0000'>Fall 2026</font>***, and would be grateful for any opportunity to contribute and learn ðŸ˜€. You can find my CV here: [**<font color = '#000066'>RENYUAN LIU</font>**](../assets/CV_RenyuanLiu.pdf)***<font color = '#CC0000'>ï¼ˆ2025.07.05 Updatedï¼‰</font>***.

2025.07.19 â€“ I successfully delivered an oral presentation **for the first time** at the *Living Machines 2025* conference, held at the University of Sheffield. This experience was an inspiring milestone in my research journey into bio-inspired robotics and lifelong learning. [Here are some photos from the conference.]()


## Research Interests

### <font color = '#000066'>Bio-inspired models and biologically-plausible mechanisms for life-long learning machine intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems</font>***<font color = '#CC0000'>ï¼ˆ2025.07.01 Updatedï¼‰</font>***

I am currently conducting research at the **University of York**, working with the **TurtleBot 3** and the **Franka Emika Panda** robotic platforms. My work focuses on understanding and abstracting the design principles found in biological systems, with the aim of advancing autonomous motion learning and control.

By modeling and transferring the motor and cognitive capabilities observed in humans and animals, I seek to improve robot perception, motion generation, and sensorimotor learning. This involves exploring biologically inspired mechanisms to enhance adaptability, robustness, and real-time learning in autonomous systems.

This summer, I am particularly focused on deepening our understanding of the biological foundations of **lifelong learning** â€” including the adaptability, autonomy, and resilience seen in animals. My goal is to translate these insights into novel approaches for machine intelligence, robotic control systems, and bio-inspired actuators, with an emphasis on energy efficiency, generalization, and long-term adaptability.


### <font color = '#000066'>Neuro-Embodied Micro-Robots</font>

I am transfixed by **computational neuroscience**, particularly the intersection of **bio-inspired algorithms** and **robotic systems**. I am trying to understand and model biological systems â€” especially insect visual circuits â€” that exhibit robust and efficient real-time perception, and applying these principles to real-world artificial systems.

Currently, my work focuses on:
- **Biologically-Plausible Visual Algorithms**: Developing neural models inspired by insect vision for motion perception, particularly looming detection.
- **Collision Detection in Robotic Systems**: Creating effective and efficient solutions for collision avoidance in complex and dynamic natural environments.
- **Embedded and Real-Time Implementation**: Designing neural algorithms that are efficient enough to run on extremely resource-constrained embedded platforms, supporting real-time interaction and safety in micro mobile robots.

Ultimately, I aim to advance the development of **machine life** endowed with embodied intelligence, robustness, and energy efficiency, by drawing inspiration from the compact, adaptive, and efficient nature of insect brains.
