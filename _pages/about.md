Welcome to my homepage! I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the School of Mathematics and Information Science, [Guangzhou University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.htm). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qinbing Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YIte1M8AAAAJ) at the Machine Life and Intelligence Research Centre, Guangzhou University.

## Research Interests

I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of **bio-inspired algorithms**, **computational neuroscience**, and **robotic systems**. My current research focuses on understanding and modeling how biological systems â€” especially insect visual circuits â€” perform robust and efficient perception in real time, and applying these principles to artificial systems.

More specifically, I am interested in:
- **Biologically-Plausible Visual Algorithms**: Developing neural models inspired by insect vision for motion perception, particularly looming detection.
- **Collision Detection in Robotic Systems**: Creating lightweight solutions for collision avoidance in complex and dynamic natural environments.
- **Embedded and Real-Time Implementation**: Designing neural algorithms that are efficient enough to run on extremely resource-constrained embedded platforms, supporting real-time interaction and safety in micro mobile robots.

Ultimately, I aim to advance the development of **machine life** endowed with embodied intelligence, robustness, and energy efficiency, by drawing inspiration from the compact, adaptive, and efficient nature of insect brains.


I am actively looking for research or graduate positions for Fall 2026, and would be grateful for any opportunity to contribute and learn ðŸ˜€. You can find my CV here: [Renyuan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_RenyuanLiu.pdf).
