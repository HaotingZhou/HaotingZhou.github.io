I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Gaungzhou University](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes robotics, neuron networks, machine vision, motion perception and bio-inspired systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qinbing Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YIte1M8AAAAJ) of Machine Life and Intellegence Research Centre from [School of Mathematics and Information Science], Guangzhou University. 

You can find my CV here: [Renyuan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
