Welcome to my homepage! I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the School of Mathematics and Information Science, [Guangzhou University](https://english.gzhu.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qinbing Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YIte1M8AAAAJ) at the Machine Life and Intelligence Research Centre, Guangzhou University.

I am actively looking for research or graduate positions for ***<font color = '#CC0000'>Fall 2026</font>***, and would be grateful for any opportunity to contribute and learn ðŸ˜€. You can find my CV here: [**<font color = '#000066'>RENYUAN LIU</font>**](../assets/CV_RenyuanLiu.pdf)***<font color = '#CC0000'>ï¼ˆ2025.07.23 Updatedï¼‰</font>***.

## Research Interests

### <font color = '#000066'>Neuro-Embodied Micro-Robots</font>

I am transfixed by **computational neuroscience**, particularly the intersection of **bio-inspired algorithms** and **robotic systems**. I am trying to understand and model biological systems â€” especially insect visual circuits â€” that exhibit robust and efficient real-time perception, and applying these principles to real-world artificial systems.

Currently, my work focuses on:
- **Biologically-Plausible Visual Algorithms**: Developing neural models inspired by insect vision for motion perception, particularly looming detection.
- **Collision Detection in Robotic Systems**: Creating effective and efficient solutions for collision avoidance in complex and dynamic natural environments.
- **Embedded and Real-Time Implementation**: Designing neural algorithms that are efficient enough to run on extremely resource-constrained embedded platforms, supporting real-time interaction and safety in micro mobile robots.

Ultimately, I aim to advance the development of **machine life** endowed with embodied intelligence, robustness, and energy efficiency, by drawing inspiration from the compact, adaptive, and efficient nature of insect brains.
